Smart contracts

Smart contract are set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for 
centralized or third party intermediary

what is the value of smart contracts - TRUST MINIMISED AGREEMENTS - unbreakable promises

- Transparency and flexibility
- Speed and effieciency
- security and immutabilt

A smart contract 
- cannot be altered
- Automatically executes
- Every one sees the terms of the agreement

Bitcoin are considered as store of value
While ethereum developers made ethereum store of value and a utility 

Blockchain cannot interact with outside world everything happen in their externel world
But in order to make contract they need external resources
This is sovled using ORACLES

ORACLES 

Any device that interacts with off-chain world to provide external data or computation to the smart contracts

Even though a single oracle can make smart contracts centralized

Therefore a oracle network is used which is decentralized

Hybrid Smart Contract
Most of the Smart contract we see today are hybrid smart contracts = blockchain contracts + off-chain data

Chainlink is an example of decentralized oracle network

DAPP = Decentralized Application = Decentralized protocol = smart contracts

Node operators - the operators running blockchain that is running the algorithms
